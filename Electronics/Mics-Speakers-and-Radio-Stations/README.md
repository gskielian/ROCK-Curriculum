Maybe we should rename this to just radio stations?

might have a cooler ring to it.


Basically will be using this folder for following types of projects:

1\. micophone amplifiers

2\. speaker actuation

and

3\. the AM radio bridge





According to Hyperphysics:

> The Amplitude Modulated (AM radio) carrier frequencies are in the frequency range 535-1605 kHz. Carrier frequencies of 540 to 1600 kHz are assigned at 10 kHz intervals. The FM radio band is from 88 to 108 MHz between VHF television Channels 6 and 7.

Basically we can start by building basic AM radio bridges using the following strategies

First circuits

> 555 + Speaker

> 555 + Crystal Oscillator + antennae


> sound source + transformer + crystal oscillator + antennae

> sound source + op-amp + antennae


We will need bigger
